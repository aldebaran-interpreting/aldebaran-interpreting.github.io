                    <p>This Site was set up to showcase my abilities in software development.</p>
                    <p>The application that you are currently viewing was written using an <a href="https://angularjs.org/">Angular</a> framework with <a href="https://github.com">Github</a> for web page hosting and as the version control system.
                    </p>
                    <p>If you are interested in looking at the files needed for this web application or even to use my application as the basis for your own resume website you can check out my repo <a href="https://github.com/sammaphey/sammaphey.github.io">
                      here.</a>
                    </p>
                    <p>While at the current moment I do acknowledge that developing an app like this in an angular framework is a bit of overkill given
                      the scope of this project the goal was to display my knowledge of angular.
                      In addition I will hopefully be implementing a small game to show off angular even more</p>
