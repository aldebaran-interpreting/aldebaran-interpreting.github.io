        <p><b>How do I request a sign language interpreter?</b>
          Please contact Aldebaran Interpreting Services at <a href="tel:315-955-5223">315-955-5223</a>, or email at <a href="mailto:thirdeyeterp@protonmail.com">thirdeyeterp@protonmail.com</a>.</p>
        <p><b>How far in advance should I request Interpreting Services?</b> For best results, request should be made as soon as appointment or event is scheduled.</p>
        <p><b>Why do I need to Provide an Interpreter?</b> By using a Qualified Interpreter, you can be assured that the skills of the interpreter meet a national standard and satisfy ADA requirements, reducing your liability.</p>
        <p><b>Can’t a friend or family member interpret?</b> Communication is compromised when a friend or family member assumes the role of neutral, unbiased interpreter. Clients are entitled to a qualified interpreter.</p>
        <p><b>Will my request need a team of interpreters?</b> Due to the physical, mental and/ or logistical demands of the work some assignments, regardless of length, may require special preparation or teams. Professional judgment and experience will be used in making a final decision. <b>Charges will apply per interpreter.</b></p>
        <p><b>Who is responsible for paying the interpreter?</b> Under Titles II&III of the ADA (<a href="https://www.ada.gov/">Americans with Disabilities Actof 1990</a>), the business entity, doctor’s office, dental practice, government agency, hospital,
            private organization, courthouse/jail, public entity, private or public school is responsible to provide communication access for individuals with disabilities. It is not the responsibility of the disabled individual to pay for accommodations.

        <h3>How to interact in an interpreted environment</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Speak clearly and at a normal pace.</li>
          <li>Address each individual(s) personally and directly.</li>
          <li>Be Patient. The interpreter may be a sentence or two behind the person communicating. This is part of the interpreting process. Expect slight delays in getting responses to questions or in the next “turn” in the conversation.</li>
          <li>Allow the interpreter to place herself/himself appropriately.</li>
          <li>Supply the interpreter with any materials, hand-outs, etc. for review, in order to facilitate a clearer interpretation. This is especially important with technical and detailed materials</li>
          <li>Remember when making requests, we recommend doing so at least 2 weeks in advance to make sure we are able to confirm an interpreter.</li>
          <li>Contact Aldebaran Interpreting Service with as much advance notice as possible. Requests may be made by <a href="tel:315-955-5223">telephone</a> and <a href="mailto:thirdeyeterp@protonmail.com">email</a>.</li>
