                  The job of an interpreter is to bridge the communication gap between Deaf/Hard of Hearing and Hearing individuals. Adherence to a Code of Professional Conduct as outlined by the Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf (RID) which grants confidentiality to all parties involved in the communication process, is of utmost importance. It is important to note that not every person who can sign is an interpreter. Interpreters have a specialized set of skills in breaking down cultural and linguistic barriers, as well as a command of both languages involved.
